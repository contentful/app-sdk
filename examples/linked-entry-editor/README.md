### Inline linked entry editor

This custom widget allows editors to edit the content of linked entries
inline from the parent entry.

It gets applied to a `Linked Entry` field type and displays the linked entry
inline in a text input element. The linked entry should have a Symbol / Short
Text field type in order to get displayed correctly.
