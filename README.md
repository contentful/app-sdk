# Contentful Widget SDK

The custom widgets API allows you to personalize the Contentful Web Application's entry editor, so that you can build plugins that meet your specific content editing or content management needs. It operates on top of any of our current field types, and gives you the power to manipulate its data through an iframe where you can embed custom functionality, styling, integrations or workflows.

### Usage

[Download the library](link) and include it in your HTML.

```html
<script src="cf-widget-api.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can [build it yourself](#buildyourself).
